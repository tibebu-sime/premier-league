Task
=====
Background: Arsenal is a professional football club based in London that plays in the Englishe Premier League.

The dataset collected is based on Arsenal game results after some matches played up to December 18th each year from 1992/93 to 2020/21. I am interested in comparing games won, lost and drawn against the total matches played. Based on the output of the visualization, I will give my prediction of how the remaining season is going to look like for the Gunners.

Conclusion
==========
From the stacked bar graphs and line plots, we can see that the Arsenal team was having one of their worst ever Premier League starts on record in these 3 decades.From 13 matches played so far, they have 14 points and are placed in 15th on the table. One striking point is that the number of matches lost during the 2020/21 season has been one of their highest since the season 1992/93. This trends indicates that the remainder of the season is likely to look bad for Arsenal.
